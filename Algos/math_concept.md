Some Important Propertires:

1.  Commutative:
    Definition: The order of elements does not affect the result of an operation.
    a + b = b + a;
    a √ó b = b √ó a;

    \*\* -, / operation doesn't follow this prop

2.  Associative:
    Definition: The grouping of elements does not affect the result of an operation.

        (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
        (a √ó b) √ó c = a √ó ( b √ó c)

    \*\* -, / does't follow this prop

3.  Distributive:
    Definition: One operation distributes over another operation.

    a √ó (b + c) = (a √ó b) + (a √ó c)

4.  Identity Property:
    Additive Identity:
    ùëé + 0 = ùëé
    Multiplicative Identity:
    a √ó 1 = a

5.  Inverse Property:
    Additive Inverse:
    a + (‚àía) = 0
    Multiplicative Inverse:
    a √ó 1/a = 1 (for non-zero a)

6.  Closure Property:
    Definition: When two elements are combined using an operation, the result is also an element of the same set.

    Example: Addition of Integers: Adding two integers results in an integer.
