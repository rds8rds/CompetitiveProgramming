#### Response 1: 
The diagram illustrates the process of collecting rain water and processing it for drinking purpose in a town of Australia.

overview: 

Overall the rain water is collected from the houses and passed through the filter then it is stored in storage, then it is passed to where treatment where it is treated with chemicals and to make it fit for human consumption 

Paragraph A:

Initially, the rain which falls on the rooftop is collected with the gutter is sent to water filter through drain, where water is separated from miniscule particles and after that it is stored in tank, from where it is put to water treatment tank, ~~there it is chemically processed to kill any bacteria or germs and made ready to be used back to the households in the town.~~ When the water is ready for drinking, it is sent along pipes that lead back to into the houses in the town where people can use the water for daily consumption. 

#### Response 2:
The diagram illusttrates the process of harvesting rainwater for the use of drinking in a town in Australia. 

The process involes `six crucial` steps from harvesting the rainwater to distribution of the treated rainwater to the households that is fit for human consumption 

`The first step` aims to funnel the rainwater and direct it from the roof to a system of `interconnected` pipes to the drain, through which the water is sent to filter that purify the rainwater and get rid of `colloidal particles`. This filtered water is then sent to a storage unit via network of pipes that collect the filtered rainwater. 


Once the storage container has the `required amount` of filtered water, it is transported to a water treatment plant, where it undergoes different stages of treatment to get rid of disease causing bacterias. It invloves addition of external agensts like chemicals to filter out micro-organims that `can not be filtered with a physical filter.` After the water is treated and is tested for comsumption, the chemically treated water is distributed via pipes. `Each house can access the drinking water through their sink.`


### Situation 2:

#### my response: 
The pie charts illustrates the sources and contriubution of total energy necessity of France in the year of 1995 and 2005. 

Overall the two pie charts depicts changes *that* happened in each enrgy production ~~sources~~ source [grammer] within a decade and their overall contribution in total energy sector of France in 1995 and 2005. 

In *the* first pie chart, in 1995, the ~~french~~ French were ~~depend~~ dependent on gas, coal, and petrolium based sources for their major need of Eneegy roughly 90% of the total need, where each fields contibuitons ~~are~~ were roughly around 30%. The remaining 10% deficiency ~~is~~ was covered by Nuclear and other energy sources where each was responsible for 6.40% and 4.90% **respectively**

**past tensed situation**
And for the second pie chart although gas and coal ~~are~~ holding their energy production share of 30% each for overall energy necessity but there ~~are~~ were changes in remainings. The first one is *the* downfall of ~~pertrolium~~ petroleum based energy plants, which is not just barely more than 19% a sharp close to 10% decrese than previous holding and there was also some increments to compensate these fall, it was observed that the ~~neulcear~~ neuclear sector hold around 10% of total energy production and other sources contribute to just more than 9%, so both neuclear and other sources rose from previous holdings.

In conclusion, while coal and gas remainded consistent, French diversified its energy production over the *decade*, relying less on petroleum and more on nuclear and alternative sources.

#### gpt response: 

The pie charts compare the energy production in France by source in 1995 and 2005, **detailing the percentage contributions of five different** energy types.

Overall, while coal and gas remained the **dominant** sources of energy in both years, there were **significant shifts** in the contributions of other energy sources. **Most notably**, the reliance on petroleum decreased sharply, while the use of nuclear and other alternative sources increased, **reflecting a more diversified energy mix by 2005.**

In 1995, coal, gas, and petroleum were nearly equal in their contributions, **with coal at 29.80%, gas at 29.63%, and petroleum slightly lower at 29.27%.** Together, these three fossil fuels accounted for almost 90% of the total energy production. Nuclear energy and other sources **played relatively minor roles**, **contributing** 6.40% and 4.90%, **respectively**.

By 2005, the energy mix **had undergone some changes**. Coal and gas remained stable, at 30.93% and 30.31% respectively, maintaining their dominant positions. However, petroleum **experienced a significant drop**, falling to 19.55%, a reduction of nearly 10%. This decline was **counterbalanced** by **substantial increases** in nuclear and other energy sources, which rose to 10.10% and 9.10%, respectively. **This suggests a shift towards cleaner or alternative energy sources.**

In conclusion, over the **ten-year period,** France's energy production **diversified**, with a reduced reliance on petroleum and a marked increase in nuclear and other alternative energies, while coal and gas remained constant in their contributions.


#### Liz Response: 

The two pie charts illustrate the proportion of five sources of energy procution (coal, gas, neuclear, petrol and other sources) in France int wo years (1995 and 2005).

Overall`,` in both years coal and gas accounted for over half of all energy production, while the least was other energy sources. There was only a very minimal increase in production from gas and coal, `whereas` nuclear and other sources almost doubled. `Petrol was the only energy source to decrese over ther period.` 

Energy produced by coal comprised of 29.90% in 1995 and by 2005, it increased by about 1% to 30.9%. Likewise, the amount of energy generated by gas went up by approximately 1% from 29.63% in the first year to 30.1% by the final year. The use of nuclear power rose sgnificantly from 6.40% in 1995 to 10.10% in 2005. Other sources of energy production accounted for 4.90% but hten climbed to 9.10%. 

`Petrol, on the other hand, produced 29.27% of all energy in 1995 but 10 years later only 19.55% of enrgy came from this source.  `
